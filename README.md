# Movie API

## Project Description 
This project is all about the backend, or server-side, of the development process. I am using JavaScript, Node.js, and Express to create an API that can communicate between an app and a database, as well MongoDB to create my own non-relational database to go with it.

## Objective
Here's how a movie app works on the server side. Various movies, directors, and genres are offered in the app. Registration and login are available, as well as updating personal information and creating a list of favorite movies. MongoDB, Node.js, and Express are used to build the REST API. Modeling the business logic with Mongoose is used. The API endpoints are accessible via HTTP methods (POST, GET, PUT, and DELETE) for creating, reading, updating, and deleting database data (CRUD).
